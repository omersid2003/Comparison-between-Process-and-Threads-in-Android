# Comparison-between-Process-and-Threads-in-Android

This project focuses on analyzing the differences between processes and threads in Android
by executing sorting algorithms. Threads share memory and are generally faster but may
introduce synchronization issues, while processes are isolated and more secure but with
higher overhead. The goal is to evaluate performance and efficiency in terms of speed,
memory usage, and system resource management.

Implementation:
● Sorting algorithms will be implemented using both processes and threads.
● The project will be coded in C and executed on an Ubuntu platform.
● Performance metrics like execution time and memory usage will be gathered for each
approach.
● The results will be visualized using a performance graph comparing processes and
threads.

Outcome:
The project will result in a detailed comparison between the two concurrency models,
highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. The graphical analysis will demonstrate which
method is more suitable for specific tasks, providing useful insights for developers working
on performance-critical Android applications.
